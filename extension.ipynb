    "**Motivation:** Alzheimer's is the 6$^{th}$ leading cause of death in the United states with over 5 million affected individuals in 2015 alone. By 2050, Alzheimer's will cost America an estimated $1.1 trillion dollars in untimely loss of quality adjusted life years and medical procedures. Understanding and preventing Alzheimers is an important issue in medical science, and mathematical tools for prediction and modeling are becoming more and more accepted. In the current article we suggest an extension to the Hodgkin Huxley model for neuronal excitation which takes into account several new variables relating to Alzheimer's and dimensia in general.\n",
